# Requirements
- Install latest Python Version
- Install MySQL
- Install all of the required libraries (mentioned in "Requirements.txt")

# Steps to Replicate
- get the python and MySQL Connector and ensure it is working
- make sure all the required libraries are installed and up to date
- then just run the python file after changing the password to the password set up while installing mysql

# Note
- This can be easily replicated by using sqlite or other sql backend software that does not require autentication,but this will definitly compromise the security
- I made this within a span of 2 weeks and this can easily be rewritten with more features by anyone who is willing to learn
- The pdf I have attached is the Project file and pages 14-21 contains the flowcharts for the program
